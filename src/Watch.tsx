/**
 * A simple utility to create stylish console logs in the browser within collapsed groups.
 * It can be used as a component or a method.
 *
 * In JSX, it is used as a match component.
 * In React components, outside JSX, we can write it as 'watchThis' method.
 *
 * @param {any} what - The value/variable/data you need to console. If it's an object, send it as an object.
 * @param {string} kind - Optional. Property of console. Default is 'log'. Other values for kind could be 'warn', 'error', etc.
 * @param {string} from - Optional. Additional details, such as filename or date.
