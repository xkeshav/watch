in react application, while development, we have to see the data and value being passed and the conventional way of checking the variable is write console.log() in application. This is a traditional way but here are few tradeoff of this approach

1. writing console.log in various files and later we have to remove from each file is a cumbersome task.

2. eslint error will be there if we miss to remove/comment console.log from any of file

3. within JSX, we can not write console.log() without {}

4. to print various variable, we have to write multiple console.log

5. there is no way to get the data in page but in the console.

de Repo

6. in production console keep getting printed.
